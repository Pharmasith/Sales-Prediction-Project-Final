Sales Prediction Project Final

Author: Ryan Croasdale

Project Description

The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. Create a model by which Big Mart can analyse and predict the outlet production sales

Data:

Methods:
After cleaning the data and completing preprocessing, I used Linear Regression and a Random Forest model to express the data

Results

A barplot of outlet type vs outlet sales. The larger the store the more sales it does on average.

A barplot that expresses the count of each item type in the dataset

Conclusion

-The Items bought are more of Low Fat

-"Fruits and vegetables" and "Snack food" are the most sold items in all the stores with all sizes.

-The Item Outles sales are high for both Low Fat and Regular Item types, so its not justified why all the outlets have more low fat products than regular.

-The items with visibility near to zero is rarely purchased by the customers.

The "Outlet_Establishment_Year" has no effect on the sales made by any outlet, as the number of sales made or the mean of all years are nearly the same .
